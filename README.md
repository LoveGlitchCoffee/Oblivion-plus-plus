Oblivion Theme catered for C++

Port of gedit/emacs' Oblivion theme, developed by Palo Borelli.

Imperfect due to how TM scope works, maybe can improve in the future.

WARNING: [C/C++ Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) v0.24 and above is overriding some CSS values. Hence to get the accurate theme, please install v0.23 and below.

**Enjoy!**
